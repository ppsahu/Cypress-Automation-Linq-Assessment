# Linq Cypress Testing Suite

This repository contains automated end-to-end tests for the Linq application using Cypress. The tests are designed to validate the behaviour and functionality of the Linq welcome page and authentication flows.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The test suite includes:
- Explicit assertions to validate basic functionality for Phone Number
- Implicit assertions to thoroughly test UI elements and behavior
- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration on macOS
